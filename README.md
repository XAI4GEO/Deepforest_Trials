# Model_Trials
Repository contains notebook tutorials and exploratory ideas for performing XAI with tree crown detection and classification.

# Folders

Data_exploration: Contains notebook exploring different datasets in corresponding folders (IDTreeS and Reforestree)

Deep_forest: Contains notebooks exploring application of the deep_forest tree detection model to the Atlantic forest UAV imagery

Geocoded_object_extractor: Contains python program to extract geocoded objects from images using shapefiles containing detected object boxes. This program is to be created in to a python package at a later date.

Siamese_network: Contains notebooks exploring the training and testing of the siamese model for different data-sets (IDTreeS and Reforestree)
